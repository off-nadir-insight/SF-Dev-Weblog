The Salesforce Mentor book club is reading Clean Code by Robert Martin with the start of February [link] and I thought it would be fun to practice some of the exercises with Apex. The exercise was more enjoyable than I had guessed it would be, along with 'much slower' and 'frustrating' than originally anticipated, but I was also laughing along the way and appreciated the chance to understand it just a little more with continued practice.
