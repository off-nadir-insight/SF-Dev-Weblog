Create a Salesforce project in VS Code
From your VS Code desktop app terminal, run:
sf project generate --name myProjectName
(alternate) From the Command Palette, use SFDX: Create project
Log in to Dev Hub & set it as default

Generate the scratch org
From the terminal in VS code, run the following command:

This org will last for 5 days (default:7 if not specified)
It will take a few minutes, and provide a new OrgId as well as a Username.
running sf org display will provide further details -- be warned, this displays senstive access information such as your Access Token
your expiration date can be found in this information
